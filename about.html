                <h3>Hello I'm</h3>
                <h1>Rene Ubalde</h1>
                <p>I’m a passionate frontend developer dedicated to creating user-friendly and visually appealing web
                    experiences. I'm always exploring the latest trends in web
                    design and development to bring fresh, innovative ideas to my projects. I’m always looking to
                    enhance my design skills by exploring tools like Figma and Adobe XD, so I can collaborate more
                    effectively with designers and bring their visions to life. I believe that a great frontend
                    developer should be able to bridge the gap between design and functionality, and that’s what I aim
                    to do in every project I take on.</p>

                <h1>Background</h1>
                <p>I'm the youngest among all four siblings. Growing up with three
                    older brothers definitely shaped my interests and experiences. My first ambition wasn’t actually to
                    be a programmer; I dreamed of being an architect. I was fascinated by buildings and design,
                    imagining how I could create structures that were both functional and beautiful.

                    Over time, though, my interests shifted. As I learned more about technology, I realized how much
                    creativity and logic went into programming, and I found myself drawn to it. While architecture was
                    about building physical spaces, programming felt like building in a digital world, where
                    possibilities felt endless.</p>

                <h1>GOAL</h1>
                <p>My goal is to pursue a career as a web developer, starting as a student, and to continuously expand
                    my skills and knowledge in the field of web development. I aim to master both front-end and back-end
                    technologies, stay up-to-date with industry trends, and work on real-world projects to gain hands-on
                    experience. Ultimately, I want to build websites and applications that are not only functional but
                    also user-friendly and innovative. I aspire to contribute to the development of innovative,
                    responsive, and visually appealing websites and web applications that can have a positive impact on
                    users. I hope to collaborate with other developers, designers, and stakeholders to create digital
                    experiences that not only meet the needs of users but also push the boundaries of what’s possible on
                    the web. Through continuous learning, collaboration, and dedication, I aim to build a successful
                    career in web development.</p>
